This project implements a systematic trading framework for stocks, futures, and options. It combines mean-reversion, trend-following, term-structure, and momentum strategies, built in Python using Zipline Reloaded and OptionSuite. The models are evaluated on a diversified universe of futures and options contracts, with emphasis on realistic execution (contract rolling, slippage, and liquidity constraints).

The goal is to develop transparent, robust strategies aligned with professional trading practices, with full documentation of the logic, implementation, execution, and performance results.
